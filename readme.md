## Install

To start a new project using Monorepo Starter, you can either **click the "Use this template"** button on GitHub or manually clone the repository. After cloning, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
npm i
```

Alternatively, you can use the `npx degit` command to clone the template into a new project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
npx degit "bent10/monorepo-starter" my-project
cd my-project
npm i
```

This monorepo starter fully supports all Vite templates, allowing you to harness the power of Vite for your frontend projects. To create a new Vite-based package, please follow these steps:

```bash
# npm 6.x
npm create vite@latest packages/foo --template vanilla

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create vite@latest packages/foo -- --template vanilla
```

1. Choose the desired project template (e.g., vanilla, react, vue,
   etc.).
2. Specify the name and location for your new package when prompted, it
   should be in the `packages` folder.
3. Your new Vite package will be created in the specified location. You
   can find it under the designated workspace folder in your monorepo.
4. Continue developing your Vite package as needed, and take advantage
   of the full Vite development environment and features.
