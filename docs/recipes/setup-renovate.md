We are using [renovateboot](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), you can see that we have set the settings in the `renovate.json` file which you can find in the root folder.

It's just that you need to install [Renovate GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/renovate) on your repository to make the workflow work.
